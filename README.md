# Usage
First you have to clone this repo (is recommended to clone into your home directory)

	```bash
	cd ~
	git clone https://github.com/ArthMcFly/git-practice
	```
	Then you have to change the original folders at your .config folders.
	Usually you would just move the files, but the ideal way is creating a soft link between both directories

	```bash
	ln -s path/of/directory ~/.config/ 
	```


# :man: Nvim config
